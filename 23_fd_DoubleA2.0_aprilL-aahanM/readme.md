## Notable things 
- can access Foundation's css via formal linkage method
    - ```<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/foundation-sites@6.7.5/dist/css/foundation.min.css" crossorigin="anonymous">```
- assign certain class name for each styling for different divs 
    - blog-post, grid-x, top-bar
- for different colors use different words such as
    - primary, secondary, success, warning, alert, white, light gray, medium gray, dark gray, black
- to change size of things use regular "style = 300px;"
- got rid of white space for css
- add **callout** for optimal costimization
    - ```<div class = callout primary large>```
    - to costumize the styling, add words following the class assignment. if the certain costumization is linked for exmaple the "small-6" connect them with a "-"
        - ```<div class = "callout large>``` : will make padding around cell large
        - ```<div class = "callout small-6>``` : will make cells smaller to the specific number scaled to 6 
    - cell works the same as callout
- to make buttons, you can just href the link you want and make it class = button and it will work
    - you cannot submit forms with these buttons, they just link things
- to align text: text-right, text-center, text-left, etc.
- significance of the dollar sign: 
    - identifier for when we want to use JavaScript
    - used to identiify variables and fucntions
    - used to be a shortcut to functions  
- **cards**: are for images with a caption
