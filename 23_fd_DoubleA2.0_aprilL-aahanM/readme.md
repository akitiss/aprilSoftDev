## Notable things 
- can access Foundation's css via formal linkage method
- assign certain class name for each styling for different divs 
    - blog-post, grid-x, top-bar
- to costumize the styling, add words following the class assignment. if the certain costumization is linked for exmaple the "small-6" connect them with a "-"
    - ```<div class = "cell large>``` : will make padding around cell large
    - ```<div class = "cell small-6>``` : will make cells smaller to the specific number scaled to 6 
- for different colors use different words such as
    - primary, secondary, success, warning, alert, white, light gray, medium gray, dark gray, black
- to change size of things use regular "style = 300px;"
- got rid of white space for css
- add ``callout`` for optimal costimization
    - ```<div class = callout primary large>```
- significance of the dollar sign: 
    - identifier for when we want to use JavaScript
    - used to identiify variables and fucntions
    - used to be a shortcut to functions
