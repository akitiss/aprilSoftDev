bubble and capture 

when the third parameter of addEventListener is activated, it'll determine if the event when be in the bubbling phase of capturing phase. 
the default is always bubbling pahse where it goes from the smallest element to its parents and so on. 
when the third parameter of addEventListener is left blank or false is written, it will stay in the default bubbling mode. 
however, when addEventListener is true, it'll switch to bubbling mode.
in capture mode, it'll go in the inverse direction from most overachering element to the smallest. 
it doesn't matter what order they are called, it'll be in the same order regardless.
