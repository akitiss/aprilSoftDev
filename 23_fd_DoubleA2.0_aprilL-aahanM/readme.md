## Notable things 
- link the Fountain's style sheet via the normal way 
- assign certain class name for each styling for different divs 
    - blog-post, grid-x, top-bar
- to costumize the styling, add words following the class assignment. if the certain costumization is linked for exmaple the "small-6" connect them with a "-"
    - <div class = "cell large"> will make padding around cell large
    - <div class = "cell small-6"> will make cells smaller to the specific number scaled to 6 
- for different colors use different words such as
    - primary, secondary
- to change size of things use regular "style = 300px;"
- got rid of white space for css
- callout: div that is really easy to edit
